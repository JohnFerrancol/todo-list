## Overview

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com): [Project: To-do List](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list). This project required us to create a To-do App taking inspiration from popular To-do Apps like [Todolist](https://en.todoist.com/), [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) and [Any.do](https://www.any.do/)

## Learning Points

- Usage of OOP Principles in writing maintainable and scable Javascript code like the SOLID Principles and Loosely coupled objects
- Implementing local storage in web applications to store data on a webpage when the page reloads
